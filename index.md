# Information on presence on Github

Most of my repositories are around UNofficialPreziProducts, but some other (hobby) projects are here as well.

## Links

### UNofficialPreziProducts

- [Suite](https://gumroad.com/l/Tiihf) <br>Java app with Posterizer & Fontinator.

- [Online Service](https://gumroad.com/products/l/wHvMqk) <br>Online service that converts Prezi to PreziPoster file. <br>Non-secure version, but quicker <br>(other people MAY see your prezi, as all Prezi files are stored in the same Dropbox folder). 

- [Online Service](https://gumroad.com/products/l/bQAt) <br>Secure version of previous service, uses IFTTT and other services<br> to get a link in YOUR email inbox.

- [Online Service](https://gumroad.com/products/l/ZxWK) <br>Converts '19page poster' to a single page, high resolution poster <br>(secure: get the link in YOUR email inbox).
<br>Suggestion: if you can run a Java app, or you know someone who can (and who you can trust), use the (free) Java app below: <br>not only is it (much) quicker, you have full control over all the files,
and it is free (as in beer).

- [Free converter](https://gumroad.com/l/jgpEm) <br>Java app that converts '19 page poster' to a single page. <br>Only needs the 19page PDF. Developed using some of the repositories present here on Github.

- [Prezi related link](https://roelvanderplank.keybase.pub/UitlegNavigatieBinnenPrezi.html) <br>Gives explanation of how to navigate with Prezi (in Dutch!).
